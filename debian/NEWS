autoconf2.13 (2.13-64) experimental; urgency=low

    Until now, the autoconf2.13 package has featured a compatibility
    wrapper, installed as "autoconf", that automatically chose between
    Autoconf 2.13 and the latest 2.50+ release.  This wrapper has now been
    removed.  Please invoke autoconf2.13, autoheader2.13, etc., by hand
    now.
